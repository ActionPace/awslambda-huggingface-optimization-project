            "content": "Natural Language Processing for Everybody . After about a month of setting up basic concept and executing it, I have reached a milestone and am ready to start sharing my results and plans regarding this project. . Essentially, my goal was to run a fairly extensive optimization test with the goal of running Huggingface language models on AWS Lambda Serverless. . The idea is that hosting these large, relatively slow language models can become expensive on dedicated and GPU equipped dedicated hosts. . If it were possible to make use of the AWS Lambda Serverless environment and utilize all available hardware and optimization tools and techniques, would it be possible to obtain acceptable response time? . . This is what I wanted to find out! . After some initial research, I discovered that there are two kinds of CPU architectures available on AWS Lambda: . There is the X86 processor and also the Graviton2 ARM architecture. . According to Amazon, there is a lot of potential power and price savings to be had with this processor. . So, I set out to set up a Optimization Test where I could get response times from a basic Huggingface language model for 2 different architectures and 4 different operating systems. . .",

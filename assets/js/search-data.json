            "content": "First Post about this project . After about a month of setting up basic concept and executing it, I have reached a milestone and am ready to start sharing my results and plans regarding this project. . Essentially, my goal was to run a fairly extensive optimization test with the goal of running Huggingface language models on AWS Lambda Serverless. . The idea is that hosting these large, relatively slow language models can become expensive on dedicated and GPU equipped dedicated hosts. . If it were possible to make use of the AWS Lambda Serverless environment and utilize all available hardware and optimization tools and techniques, would it be possible to obtain acceptable response time? . This is what I wanted to find out! . After some initial research, I discovered that there are two kinds of CPU architectures available on AWS Lambda: . There is the X86 processor and also the Graviton2 ARM architecture. . According to Amazon, there is a lot of potential power and price savings to be had with this processor. . So, I set out to set up a Optimization Test where I could get response times from a basic Huggingface language model for 2 different architectures and 4 different operating systems. . They are: . X86 (X86_64) | ARM (aarch64) | . and . Amazon Linux 2 | Amazon Linux 2022 | Ubuntu 20.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 | .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

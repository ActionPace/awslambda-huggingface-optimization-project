<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interested in Natural Language Processing and How to Best Use Hugging Face AND Deploy Your Transformer Models Efficiently and Cost Effectively?</strong></h1>

| **Want to know the most cost effective and straightforward way to deploy your AI experiments?**|That is one of my missions â€“ to investigate all the feasible ways to launch AI projects effectively and within budget and compare them objectively. |
| **Confused by the NLP Literature and Learning Materials and want a practical way to make use of NLP technology?**|I have devised a way to get to the heart of complicated information and extract what is most valuable and clear concepts to take action on for practical results. |
| **Want to set up experiments inexpensively yet optimally?**|This need struck me as a gap in the marketplace where I could offer my services and insight to get to the heart of practical solutions to offer. |
| **Due to the size and typically slower response of these innovative Language Models, would you like to make use of the prominent optimization methods available?**|Many companies and organizations are working on ways to optimize these models for deployment, but their code and instructions can be complicated and vague. I've taken it upon myself to dig into these options and show what's working well. |
| **Want to get started fast but you find yourself swamped in the details?**|So many sources for learning about NLP technology are overly detailed and rarely cut to the heart of practical, valuable applications. That is were we come in. Working together to apply resources to needs to supercede the current limitations in information gathering. |

### **WHAT IS THE PROCESSâ€¦?**
* Understanding the potential and uses for the technology
* Understand how to use NLP for your own purposes
* How to build something useful with NLP AI

### **STARTING TO APPLY MODELS TO REAL APPLICATIONS**
* How and where to deploy models inexpensively
* Knowing the options and prices
* Optimizing transformer models (What are the practical ways?)

### **BUILDING AI APPLICATIONS**
* Knowing the easiest ways to get started
* How to build a simple AI app which solves your own needs
* How to leverage the existing ai at low cost to you

## **PROCESS TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTING NLP AI**
1. Choose which Task Type you want to perform
  * Fill-mask
  * Question Answering
  * Sentence Similarity
  * Summarization
  * Text Classification
  * Text Generation
  * Token Classification
  * Translation
  * Zero-Shot Classification
2. Create prototype and proof of concept on Google Colab or other lost cost AI platform
3. Decide how to want to deploy your AI service
  * An app on your computer
  * A remote service on the Internet
  * A phone or mobile device
  * Embedded in a single board computer
 4. Decide on the desired response time needed to balance cost/effort needed
  * Pay more for hardware and cloud services
  * Focus on options and resources for model optimization
  * Run benchmarks and compare to baseline to see if the cost vs response time balance is optimal

## **PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT AI MODEL AT LOW COST**
1. Model size and baseline response time
2. Money for a GPU or specialized Cloud Service?
3. Want a dedicated server or latent remote service that's always there when you need it?
4. Investigate benchmarks and baseline for typical responses on various hardware/software/optimization combinations?

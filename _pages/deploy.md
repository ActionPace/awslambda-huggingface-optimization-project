## **INTRODUCING YOU TO SOME BASIC AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF NLP AI**

### **CHALLENGES TO HOSTING NLP AI MODELS**

* Why this wasn't a problem before for experimenters
* New hurdles to embedding language models into apps
* Balancing cost vs response time
* This actually creates a barrier to entry and a shortage of know-how which you can take advantage of if you start sooner than later

### **HOW TO AVOID PAYING CLOUD PROVIDERS BIG MONEY TO SIMPLY HOST YOUR MODELS**
* Logic behind choosing CPU vs GPU and Intel vs ARM
* What's a GPU really do?
* Optimizing your models without reinventing the wheel
* Utilize analysis tools to know what is really working and where the best value is
* Reap tons of value with AWS Lambda Serverless Framework
